libgudev (230-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Bump epoch for -dbg package for Ubuntu build as well, to make it
    installable.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop our hack to override the linker on sparc. This was copied over from
    the systemd split but it is no longer necessary as the libgudev build
    system does not override the default linker.

libgudev (219-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release after the split from src:systemd. We use the version
    number 219-11, since 219-10 was the last version where it was built from
    src:systemd. See also the upstream announcement at
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-May/032070.html
